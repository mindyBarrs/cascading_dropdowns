# Cascading Dropdowns

This repository is about the different ways you can create cascading dropdowns lists in Asp.Net using C# as the back-end language. Cascading dropdowns is a very useful thing when it comes to get information form a user, the most common use of them is for location information, such as country -> state/province -> city. 

This repository will be on going, I will be adding to and if anyone else wants to add to it they can. If you downoad this respository you will see a page called Fancey, but when you click on them nothing will be there because those pages are what else I will be adding to the repository. 

### Basic Cascading Dropdown Lists

> The first part that was added to the repository is the most basic version of creating cascading dropdowns, with the most basic way of 
> setting them up. The database that was used is a free database provided from Microsoft, 
> this is the [link](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/) to get the database.

### Update Panel Cascading Dropdown Lists

> Another way to create cascading dropdowns, but this way doesn't make the page re-load everytime a selection is made. The way this is 
> accomplished is by using the update panel, that is located in the toolbox under Ajax Extenctions.

### Ajax Cascading Dropdown Lists

> This is another way to create Cascading Dropdowns, by using an Ajax Control Toolkit and 
> a web service to handle the ajax calls.
